	  <h1>Overview</h1>
	  <p>Hello, and welcome to the Cornell CS Department!
	  This page serves as a collection of information about resources provided by PhD Students for PhD Students, often with support of the department, and of some more general information and HowTos we collected for you.
	  We strongly encourage you to at least browse this page to get an overview of what is available to you and who to go to in case you need something.
	  These things also do not run on their own, and the people running them may graduate or become busy with other stuff etc., so please also consider helping out.
	  In the following, we'll give an overview of the individual resource groups described on this page.
	  You can also jump directly to the more in-depth description pages.</p>
	  </div>
	  </div>
	  <div class="content"><div>
	  <h2>The Czarship System</h2>
	  <p>Czars are volunteers who have taken on a specific task to help improve how the department works.
	  If you have not yet, you may hear from some of them very soon. 
	  Most czarships either have to do with organizing a specific event, such as <a href="#czars-visitday">visit day</a>, <a href="#czars-picnic">picnic</a>, <a href="#czars-colloquium">colloquium</a>, or
	  <a href="#czars-studentbrownbag">student brown bag</a>.
	  Others take care of specific infrastructure, such as the <a href="#czars-wiki">wiki</a>, the <a href="#czars-espresso">espresso machine</a>, the <a href="#czars-foosball">foosball table</a>, or even our <a href="#czars-desk">office placements</a>.
	  Finally, in order to fill these positions and keep track of them, there is the <a href="#czars-czarczar">czar-czar</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can find <a href="#czars">more about the Czarship System on this page</a> or on the department's <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/czars/">Czars page</a>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2>CSGO - The Computer Science Graduate Organization</h2>
	  <p>The CSGO is the body of political representation of all graduate students in the field of computer science.
	  It serves as the interface to talk to the faculty and administration about graduate student concerns, such
	  as requirements, communication policies, etc., and sends representatives to the larger representative bodies,
	  i.e. the <a href="http://www.egsa.cornell.edu/">Engineering Graduate Students Association</a> and <a href="http://assembly.cornell.edu/GPSA/Home">Graduate and Professional Student Assembly</a>.
	  CSGO can also provide funding for student activities and events.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can find <a href="#csgo">more about the CSGO on this page</a> or on the <a href="#">CSGO website</a>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2>Communication and Further Resources</h2>
	  <p>This guide is not complete.
	  Neither does it contain all details of the different things mentioned here,
	  it also does not at all contain your practice talk, random rants or suggestions to and planning of seeing movies together.
	  There are loads of different mailing list you either are or can be on, the most important of which are 
	  <a class="mailto-cs-phd-students">CS-PHD-Students (JavaScript needed for e-mail address to show)</a> (for announcements, reaches everyone),
	  <a class="mailto-phd-social">CS-PHD-Social (JavaScript needed for e-mail address to show)</a> (opt-in, for getting advice, ranting, and organizing things),
	  <a class="mailto-phd-private">CS-PHD-Private (JavaScript needed for e-mail address to show)</a> (opt-in, like PHD-social, but without faculty and admins).
	  Recently, some functionality of PHD-Social and some specialized mailings lists has shifted over to an IRC-like service called <a href="http://cornellcis.slack.com">Slack</a>.
	  Besides those lists, there are a few websites that are worth knowing, such as the <a href="http://www.it.cornell.edu/support/coecis/">CS-specific IT-resources</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>More on those mailing lists and how to join them, and other common resources <a href="#comm">later on this page</a>.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Regular Meetings and Events</h2>
	  <p>
	  There are lots of regularly scheduled things and some special events throughout the year that you should be aware of.
	  Some of them you are more or less formally expected to attend, many of them are quite fun (whether you think the intersection of those two sets is non-empty is up to you).
	  Examples of such events are the <a href="">CS Colloquium</a>, <a href="">Brown-Bag Talks</a> (and their <a href="">student version</a>), the <a href="">CS Picnic</a> and the department's Holiday Party.
	  </p>
	  <p>As you may have guessed, you can find a <a href="#events">more detailed list and schedule on this page</a>.
	  <h2>HowTos</h2>
	  <p>
	  In an effort to help you with some of your more immediate concern, this site contains a <a href="#howtos">collection of (hopefully) helpful
	  explanations and links</a> for common tasks such as setting up a printer, the VPN, hosting Social Hour, getting mail to the department, etc.

	  <p>Czars are volunteers who have taken on a specific task to help improve how the department works.
	  If you have not yet, you may hear from some of them very soon.</p>
	  <p>
	  Most czarships either have to do with organizing a specific event or take care of specific infrastructure.
	  You can see a list of all of them below (at the time of writing this guide - the up-to-date list is always at <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/czars/">the department's czars page</a>, but currently features neither photos nor links nor non-job-descriptions).
	  The system heavily depends on students volunteering, so please consider helping out (especially when a call goes out).

	  The commitment is usually 3:45 PM - 5:30 PM for 3-6 colloquia a semester depending on your availability. 
	  The earlier you sign up to do this, the easier it is to meet and impress cool future faculty in your area!

	  I help the administration keep track of who sits where and assign new offices in exchange for you having lots of choice in the matter.
	  Once a year, I send out a questionnaire where you can tell me if and what office you would like to move to, and I'll make that happen if there is space (else you will hear from me).
	  I am also the person to talk to if you want to move to another office during the year (but please don't just move all the time).
	  </p><p>Often, faculty can arrange for you to get access to a particular room so you can move, but you're making my work a lot easier if you
	  let either Becky or me know that you moved (because otherwise we might think that your new desk is still free).
	  </p>
	  <p>"Desk" Czar is a misnomer - I only keep track of things on the level of rooms.</p>

	  We have $225 of budget for the entire event. 
	  $15 is already spent on wine and you don't need to purchase wine. 
	  For the rest of the budget an $85 and $125 is a good split for alcoholic drinks(not wine) and snacks/non-alcoholic drinks.

	  The czar organizes weekly talks by students, usually describing current research, but sometimes also discussing useful research tools such as reference managers. 
	  The czar's main duties are getting speakers lined up (this usually involves sending emails and bugging people in person), and ordering food for the seminar (very easy, done using Cornell e-shop).
	  If you want to practice your talk, get feedback on an idea from other students or just want to tell others about some cool thing you learned, let me know and I’ll set you up for a talk. 
	  I also might approach you to ask if you could do any of the above at some point to fill some slots.

	  <h3>Colloquium</h3>
	  <p>The CS Colloquium is a series of invited talks given by speakers from outside of the department.
	  PhD students are generally expected to attend these (it is also a course - CS 7090 - for which you should register).
	  Usually, there is a reception before the Colloquium (most times in (front of) Gates 416 - "New Visions").
	  The spring semester typically features lots of hiring talks, often also on Tuesdays.
	  This is where you can get an impression of potential new faculty.</p>
	  
	  <p>To see upcoming talks, you can look at the current <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/events/colloquium">colloquium schedule</a>. Usually, there are also a bunch of e-mail announcements about a week before and at the start of the reception.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Brown-Bag Talks</h3>
	  <p>Brown-Bag talks are brown-bag in name only. 
	  Usually, food is actually provided.
	  At the Tuesday brown bag, faculty talk about their current research projects and/or general topics of interest to PhD students (e.g. "How to Give a Research Talk").
	  At the Wednesday student brown bag, students talk about their current research, or ideas they want to get feedback on, or give practice talks.
	  The format there is very flexible and can be discussed with the <a href="">Student Brown Bag Czar</a>.</p>
	  
	  <p>Here are the links to the schedules of the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jshi/brownbag/">CS Brown Bag</a> (Tuesdays) and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X2xyoLAHeMoQyQEcBIDRN6lpvp24ur3XwRfthJkHCWI/edit#gid=2135342766">Student Brown Bag</a> (Wednesdays).</p>
	  
	  <h3>Area Seminars</h3>
	  <p>
	  Many research areas have weekly seminars run as courses.
	  These seminars usually provide food in one form or another, particularly Systems Lunch and AI Lunch.
	  If you are working in one of those areas, you should register for the respective seminar course (CS 7xxx).
	  However, you are usually welcome to attend any of these even without registering, and in fact should do so if it sounds interesting to you.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Student-Run Seminars</h3>
	  Some students interested in particular topics or discussion formats have also started inofficial seminars.
	  If you want to do that on your own, all you need is some faculty to back requests for a mailing list and a regular room reservation (and potentially funding for food).
	  Groups organized after this scheme are:
