	  <h1>Overview</h1>
	  <p>Hello, and welcome to the Cornell CS Department!
	  This page serves as a collection of information about resources provided by PhD Students for PhD Students, often with support of the department, and of some more general information and HowTos we collected for you.
	  We strongly encourage you to at least browse this page to get an overview of what is available to you and who to go to in case you need something.
	  These things also do not run on their own, and the people running them may graduate or become busy with other stuff etc., so please also consider helping out.
	  In the following, we'll give an overview of the individual resource groups described on this page.
	  You can also jump directly to the more in-depth description pages.</p>

	  <h2>The Czarship System</h2>
	  <p>Czars are volunteers who have taken on a specific task to help improve how the department works.
	  If you have not yet, you may hear from some of them very soon. 
	  Most czarships either have to do with organizing a specific event, such as <a href="#">visit day</a>, <a href="#">picnic</a>, <a href="#">colloquium</a>, or
	  <a href="#">student brown bag</a>.
	  Others take care of specific infrastructure, such as the <a href="#">wiki</a>, the <a href="#">espresso machine</a>, the <a href="#">foosball table</a>, or even our <a href="#">office placements</a>.
	  Finally, in order to fill these positions and keep track of them, there is the <a href="#">czar-czar</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can find <a href="#czars">more about the Czarship System on this page</a> or on the department's <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/czars/">Czars page</a>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2>CSGO - The Computer Science Graduate Organization</h2>
	  <p>The CSGO is the body of political representation of all graduate students in the field of computer science.
	  It serves as the interface to talk to the faculty and administration about graduate student concerns, such
	  as requirements, communication policies, etc., and sends representatives to the larger representative bodies,
	  i.e. the <a href="http://www.egsa.cornell.edu/">Engineering Graduate Students Association</a> and <a href="http://assembly.cornell.edu/GPSA/Home">Graduate and Professional Student Assembly</a>.
	  CSGO can also provide funding for student activities and events.
	  </p>
	  <p>You can find <a href="#csgo">more about the CSGO on this page</a> or on the <a href="#">CSGO website</a>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h2>Communication and Further Resources</h2>
	  <p>This guide is not complete.
	  Neither does it contain all details of the different things mentioned here,
	  it also does not at all contain your practice talk, random rants or suggestions to and planning of seeing movies together.
	  There are loads of different mailing list you either are or can be on, the most important of which are 
	  <a href="mailto:cs-phd-students-l@cornell.edu">CS-PHD-Students</a> (for announcements, reaches everyone),
	  <a href="mailto:cornell-cs-phd-social@googlegroups.com">CS-PHD-Social</a> (opt-in, for getting advice, ranting, and organizing things),
	  <a href="mailto:cornell-cs-phd-private@googlegroups.com">CS-PHD-Private</a> (opt-in, like PHD-social, but without faculty and admins).
	  Recently, some functionality of PHD-Social and some specialized mailings lists has shifted over to an IRC-like service called <a href="http://cornellcis.slack.com">Slack</a>.
	  Besides those lists, there are a few websites that are worth knowing, such as the <a href="http://www.it.cornell.edu/support/coecis/">CS-specific IT-resources</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>More on those mailing lists and how to join them, and other common resources <a href="#comm">later on this page</a>.</p>
	  
	  <h2>Regular Meetings and Events</h2>
	  <p>
	  There are lots of regularly scheduled things and some special events throughout the year that you should be aware of.
	  Some of them you are more or less formally expected to attend, many of them are quite fun (whether you think the intersection of those two sets is non-empty is up to you).
	  Examples of such events are the <a href="">CS Colloquium</a>, <a href="">Brown-Bag Talks</a> (and their <a href="">student version</a>), the <a href="">CS Picnic</a> and the department's Holiday Party.
	  </p>
	  <p>As you may have guessed, you can find a <a href="#events">more detailed list and schedule on this page</a>.
	  <h2>HowTos</h2>
	  <p>
	  In an effort to help you with some of your more immediate concern, this site contains a <a href="#howtos">collection of (hopefully) helpful
	  explanations and links</a> for common tasks such as setting up a printer, the VPN, hosting Social Hour, getting mail to the department, etc.
